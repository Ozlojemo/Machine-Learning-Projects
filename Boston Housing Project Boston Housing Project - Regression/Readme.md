# Boston-House Project

## Regression Practice Project

This project aims to build a regression model to predict the prices of houses in Boston. We will use various techniques and algorithms to:

1. Preprocess the data.
2. Detect and handle missing values and outliers.
3. Select features.
4. Train and evaluate the model.
