# Boston-House Project

## Regression Practice Project

This project aims to build a regression model to predict the prices of houses in Boston. We will use various techniques and algorithms to:

1. Preprocess the data.
2. Detect and handle missing values and outliers.
3. Select features.
4. Train and evaluate the model.


## Libraries Used
a.Numpy
b.Pandas
c.Matplotlib
d.Seaborn
e.Scikit-learn





## Conclusion
The linear regression model was able to predict the prices of houses in Boston with an R-squared value of 0.812 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.025. The polynomial regression model, on the other hand, was able to predict the prices of houses with an R-squared value of 0.813 and an MSE of 0.025. Both models had similar performance, but the polynomial regression model was slightly better
