# Market Segmentation

Overview
This project aims to analyze market segmentation data to extract valuable insights for a company. The dataset used in this analysis contains information about sales transactions, including representatives, products, quantity, revenue, and region. The goal is to understand the sales trends, revenue generation, and product segmentation.

## Data
The dataset consists of 10,000 observations or transactions with 5 variables: reps, products, quantity, revenue, and region. The reps variable represents the representatives involved in product promotion and sales. The products variable includes 12 brands of products promoted by the company. Quantity (qty) represents the quantity sold in units, while revenue indicates the revenue generated for each transaction. The region variable categorizes the transactions into four regions - East, North, South, and West India.

## Analysis Steps
Data Exploration: The initial step involves exploring the dataset's structure, summary statistics, unique values, and variable distributions to gain a better understanding of the data.

## Revenue and Quantity Analysis: 

This analysis breaks down revenue and quantity by products and regions to identify fast-moving products and revenue generation by representatives in their respective regions.

## Product Analysis: 

Further exploration focuses on the count of transactions and total quantity sold for each product, providing insights into product popularity and demand.

## Region-wise Revenue Analysis:

This analysis summarizes the revenue generated by representatives in each region and visualizes it through bar charts to understand the regional revenue distribution.

## Per Capita Revenue: 

The per capita revenue analysis calculates the average revenue generated in each region, considering the number of sales representatives. This helps determine the revenue generated per person in each region.

## Product Segmentation: 

This analysis focuses on revenue generation by product in each region, providing insights into product performance and regional preferences.

## Unit Price Analysis: 

The unit price analysis calculates the average unit price for each product and visualizes it through a bar chart. This helps identify high and low-priced products.

## Summary of Transactions and Revenue: 

This section summarizes the total transactions and revenue generated by each representative, providing an overview of their sales performance.

# Clustering Analysis: 

Two clustering algorithms, Hierarchical clustering and K-Means, are used to segment the data based on transactions and revenue. The clusters are visualized using scatter plots and dendrograms.

## Dependencies
To run the analysis, the following libraries are required:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sklearn


# Findings
Based on the analysis conducted, the following findings were observed:

1. The North region had the highest revenue generation, followed by the South, West, and East regions.
2. There was a positive correlation between the unit price and revenue, indicating that higher-priced products tend to generate more revenue.
3. The clustering analysis revealed distinct groups of transactions and revenue patterns, indicating different market segments within the dataset.

# Final Observations

Based on the analysis conducted, the following observations can be made:

1. The North region shows the highest revenue potential and should be prioritized in marketing and sales efforts.
2. Pricing strategies should be carefully considered, as higher-priced products have shown a positive impact on revenue generation.
3. The identified market segments can be targeted with tailored marketing campaigns to maximize sales opportunities and
